# Daily Joke Board

Daily Joke Board to display at work.

## Description

This was a mini-project of mine that related to getting students to be more enthusiatic at work. 
I wanted to boost people's moral at work, so I created a joke board for students and employees to see while walking around the office. Jokes are changed everyday and are always open to new suggestions.

To display the content on our digital signs we use GitHub Pages. We remote into our devices that are on presentation mode. 

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the MSU students for giving me ideas for new jokes. Although this joke board may seem insignificant, I believe this has really helped as I have witnessed a differnece in the work enviornment.
